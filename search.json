    "text": "There is no doubt that Tiger Woods forever changed the trajectory of golf the moment he stepped onto the PGA Tour. Tiger almost instantly gained a cult-like following and dominated the sport to such a level that players would crumble just by being paired with him.\nHowever, Tiger not only impacted the game by drawing unfathomable crowds and effected the psyche of his opponents, but Tiger impacted the game in such a way that the physical landscape of courses changed. Courses had to “Tiger proof” themselves to help other players have a chance at beating the now 15-time major champion. Companies that produced golf equipment also had to change to give the competition a better chance against him.\nSo where is the proof that Tiger had such an impact on the game? Today I will show how Mr. Woods rise in golf caused this historic change.\nFirstly, let’s look at the most significant factor that caused the dramatic change in the landscape of golf: Driving distance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nGolf <- read.csv(\"data/golf_data_v4.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=AvgDrivingDistance), color=\"red\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(255, 300)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 1992, y = 280), label = \"Tiger's Rookie Year\", size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Tiger Woods Caused a Jump in Driving Distance Average\",\n       subtitle = \"He forced other golfers and the Tour to change they way the game was played to combat him.\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Average PGA Tour Driving Distance\",\n       caption = \"By: Chife Jaeger | Source: PGA\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nIn the graph above you can clearly see that even before Tiger arrived the average PGA Tour driving distance was trending upward. But you can also see a clear jump in the rise after Tiger joined.\nBut how did Tiger cause this? Obviously just because he was driving the ball so well didn’t all of a sudden make other players hit the ball further as well.\nThis is where the change in technology comes into play. Strictly speaking the technology of the driver.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_step(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=MaxDrivercc)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1990, 2023)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 1993, y = 325), label = \"Tiger's Rookie Year\", size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Tiger Launched Club Technology to the Future\",\n       subtitle = \"His ability to drive the ball forced the PGA Tour to have oversized metal driving heads to help other pros hit further.\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Maximum Driver Head Size Allowed by cc.\",\n       caption = \"By: Chife Jaeger | Source: Bloodline Golf\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, you can see that the club head size of the driver was beginning to get larger even before Tiger was on Tour. In 1991 the 190cc Big Bertha driver was by far the largest driver head the game had ever seen. And even though Tiger joined in 1996 the head of the driver didn’t get bigger for five years.\nBut there is something very interesting in the jump from the 250cc club head to 400cc in 2001, that was right after Tiger had won all four major championships consecutively (including the Players Championship during that spree).\nWhile these changes to the driver’s heads and the jump in driving distance average helped other players, golf courses needed to change in order to not allow players to consistently have record-low scoring.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=AverageCourseLength), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=EuropeanTourLength), color=\"orange\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(6950, 7300)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1997, 2020)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 2002.5, y = 7175), label = \"PGA Tour\", size = 3, color = \"purple\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 2007.5, y = 7075), label = \"European PGA Tour\", size = 3, color = \"orange\") +\n  labs(title = \"Courses Adjusted to the Rise in Driving Distance\",\n       subtitle = \"The sharp rise in couse length almost perfectly matches the average drivign distnace increase.\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Average PGA Tour Course Length\",\n       caption = \"By: Chife Jaeger | Source: KC-Usercontent\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is unfortunate that there is not more data from the years before Tiger’s time, you can see the trend of the golf courses follows that of the driving distance average and driver head size. Even on the Europen Tour.\nTo get a bit of a clearer idea of courses before Tiger, let’s look at the length of Augusta National and where The Open Championship was played since 1980.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=AgustaNationalLength), color=\" dark green\") +\n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=LengthofOpenChamp), color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(6850, 7450)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1980, 2023)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 1993.5, y = 7100), label = \"Augusta National\", size = 3, color = \"dark green\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 2010, y = 7000), label = \"How long the Open Championship played\", size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 1992, y = 7400), label = \"Tiger's Rookie Year\", size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Even the Most Famous Courses in the World Got Longer\",\n       subtitle = \"The sharp increse caused by Tiger forced courses to dramatically lengthen the courses.\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Average PGA Tour Course Length\",\n       caption = \"By: Chife Jaeger | Source: The Open & PGA Tour\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a little hard to follow the data from The Open Championship but you can see an average in course length in the pre-Tiger years and a jump to a higher average in the years since Tiger joined.\nThere are many different factors that Tiger brought into the game of golf that had a lasting effect on the game (being fit for example) and that made him so dominant (every other aspect of his game such as iron striking, sand saves, work around the green, and putting).\nHowever, his ability to consistently drive the ball far and accurately is certainly one of the most tangible aspects of how he changed the game of golf. Tiger’s fingerprints are everywhere in the game of golf today and they will likely continue to be there until the end of time."
