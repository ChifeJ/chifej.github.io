    "title": "How Tiger Changed Golf",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There is no doubt that Tiger Woods forever changed the trajectory of golf the moment he stepped onto the PGA Tour. Tiger almost instantly gained a cult-like following and dominated the sport to such a level that players would crumble just by being paired with him.\nHowever, Tiger not only impacted the game by drawing unfathomable crowds and effected the psyche of his opponents, but Tiger impacted the game in such a way that the physical landscape of courses changed. Courses had to “Tiger proof” themselves to help other players have a chance at beating the now 15-time major champion. Companies that produced golf equipment also had to change to give the competition a better chance against him.\nSo where is the proof that Tiger had such an impact on the game? Today I will show how Mr. Woods rise in golf caused this historic change.\nFirstly, let’s look at the most significant factor that caused the dramatic change in the landscape of golf: Driving distance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nGolf <- read.csv(\"data/golf_data_v4.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=AvgDrivingDistance), color=\"red\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(255, 300)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 1992, y = 280), label = \"Tiger's Rookie Year\", size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Tiger Woods Caused a Jump in Driving Distance Average\",\n       subtitle = \"He forced other golfers and the Tour to change they way the game was played to combat him.\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Average PGA Tour Driving Distance\",\n       caption = \"By: Chife Jaeger | Source: PGA\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nIn the graph above you can clearly see that even before Tiger arrived the average PGA Tour driving distance was trending upward. But you can also see a clear jump in the rise after Tiger joined.\nBut how did Tiger cause this? Obviously just because he was driving the ball so well didn’t all of a sudden make other players hit the ball further as well.\nThis is where the change in technology comes into play. Strictly speaking the technology of the driver.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_step(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=MaxDrivercc)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1990, 2023)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 1993, y = 325), label = \"Tiger's Rookie Year\", size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Tiger Launched Club Technology to the Future\",\n       subtitle = \"His ability to drive the ball forced the PGA Tour to have oversized metal driving heads to help other pros hit further.\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Maximum Driver Head Size Allowed by cc.\",\n       caption = \"By: Chife Jaeger | Source: Bloodline Golf\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, you can see that the club head size of the driver was beginning to get larger even before Tiger was on Tour. In 1991 the 190cc Big Bertha driver was by far the largest driver head the game had ever seen. And even though Tiger joined in 1996 the head of the driver didn’t get bigger for five years.\nBut there is something very interesting in the jump from the 250cc club head to 400cc in 2001, that was right after Tiger had won all four major championships consecutively (including the Players Championship during that spree).\nWhile these changes to the driver’s heads and the jump in driving distance average helped other players, golf courses needed to change in order to not allow players to consistently have record-low scoring.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=AverageCourseLength), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=EuropeanTourLength), color=\"orange\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(6950, 7300)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1997, 2020)) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 2002.5, y = 7175), label = \"PGA Tour\", size = 3, color = \"purple\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 2007.5, y = 7075), label = \"European PGA Tour\", size = 3, color = \"orange\") +\n  labs(title = \"Courses Adjusted to the Rise in Driving Distance\",\n       subtitle = \"The sharp rise in couse length almost perfectly matches the average drivign distnace increase.\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Average PGA Tour Course Length\",\n       caption = \"By: Chife Jaeger | Source: KC-Usercontent\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is unfortunate that there is not more data from the years before Tiger’s time, you can see the trend of the golf courses follows that of the driving distance average and driver head size. Even on the Europen Tour.\nTo get a bit of a clearer idea of courses before Tiger, let’s look at the length of Augusta National and where The Open Championship was played since 1980.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=AgustaNationalLength), color=\" dark green\") +\n  geom_line(data=Golf, aes(x=Year, y=LengthofOpenChamp), color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(6850, 7450)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1980, 2023)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 1993.5, y = 7100), label = \"Augusta National\", size = 3, color = \"dark green\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 2010, y = 7000), label = \"How long the Open Championship played\", size = 3, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 1992, y = 7400), label = \"Tiger's Rookie Year\", size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Even the Most Famous Courses in the World Got Longer\",\n       subtitle = \"The sharp increse caused by Tiger forced courses to dramatically lengthen the courses.\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Average PGA Tour Course Length\",\n       caption = \"By: Chife Jaeger | Source: The Open & PGA Tour\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a little hard to follow the data from The Open Championship but you can see an average in course length in the pre-Tiger years and a jump to a higher average in the years since Tiger joined.\nThere are many different factors that Tiger brought into the game of golf that had a lasting effect on the game (being fit for example) and that made him so dominant (every other aspect of his game such as iron striking, sand saves, work around the green, and putting).\nHowever, his ability to consistently drive the ball far and accurately is certainly one of the most tangible aspects of how he changed the game of golf. Tiger’s fingerprints are everywhere in the game of golf today and they will likely continue to be there until the end of time."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The two best regular season teams in the 2022 American Association baseball season were without a doubt the Kansas City Monarchs and the Fargo-Moorhead Redhawks. Both teams battled all season long for the division crown with Kansas City barely edging Fargo-Moorhead out for the title in the last week of the regular season.\nLater in the post-season, the two rivals met in the West Division Championship Series to decide who would represent their respective division in the Miles Wolff Cup Finals. The Redhawks ultimately defeated the Monarchs in the three games series 2-1 to advance to the finals.\nBut after having a look at the statistics from both teams in the regular season, it appeared as if the Monarchs were the clearly superior team. Kansas City boasted some of the most dominant stats the American Association had ever seen. Let’s look at some of those stats that made the Monarchs so dominant.

They didn’t have the least amount of home runs given up but they were in the upper echelon of the league in that category as well.\nThese two main stats are obviously linked as the more hits you give up the more runs you are likely to give up as well. But something else that is very interesting can be found in this graph. The Monarchs by far gave up the least amount of hits, but that red dot above them (Fargo-Moorhead) is not that far behind them in ERA. Meaning although Kansas City as a whole did have a better pitching season and gave up way fewer hits, the Redhawks were still able to limit the number of runs they gave up to be not too far behind the Monarchs.\nBut as dominant as Kansas City was in pitching that wasn’t the only thing that made them so good.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Batting,\n    aes(x = BA, y = OPS, size = W),\n    alpha = .3\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.270, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.786, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 0.267, y = 0.875), label = \"League Batting \\n Average\", size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 0.29, y = 0.793), label = \"League OPS.

The Redhawks and the Chicago Dogs may have been close to Kansas City in ERA but nobody in the American Association came close to the Monarchs in terms of batting average and OPS.\nThese weren’t the only batting statistics that Kansas City led in, they also led the league in total hits by 64, total home runs by 29, and total runs scored by 104. With batting statistics like that paired with the outstanding pitching season the Monarchs had, it would seem like Kansas City should have run away with the best record in the American Association. But they only won their division by a game.\nHow could that happen? Well Kansas City did have a great record, but Fargo-Moorhead had some other things going for them that allowed them to keep up.\n\n\nCode\nbar1 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = Pitching, aes(x = reorder(West.Division, R), weight = R)) +\n  geom_bar(data = kcm_fmr, aes(x = reorder(West.Division, R), weight = R, fill = West.Division)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Other Factors May have Cost Kansas City Ground\",\n       subtitle = \"They had the big stats but others point to why Fargo-Moorhead kept up.\",\n       x = \"Team\", y = \"Runs Given Up\", caption = \"Source: Baseball Reference | By Chife Jaeger\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"#E2D8BD\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nbar2 <- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = Batting, aes(x = reorder(West.Division, SO), weight = SO)) +\n  geom_bar(data = KCM_FMR, aes(x = reorder(West.Division, SO), weight = SO, fill = West.Division)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"\",\n       subtitle = \"\",\n       x = \"Team\", y = \"Offensive Strikeouts\", caption = \"Source: Baseball Reference | By Chife Jaeger\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\", \"#E2D8BD\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nplot_grid(bar1, bar2)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen above Kansas city had good stats in those categories but Fargo-Moorhead took the cake when it came to the best in the league. Their ability to give up less total runs and not strikeout may have won them a couple games that kept them within striking distance of the Monarchs until the last week of the season.\nI would also like to come back to the fact that the Redhawks gave up many more hits but did not have a much higher ERA. With all the hits they gave up, here is a better idea of how few earned runs Fargo-Moorhead still let score.\n\n\nCode\nER <- c(\"Kansas City\"=433, \"Fargo-Moorhead\"=438)\n\nwaffle(\n        ER/5, \n        rows = 5, \n        title=\"\",\n        xlab=\"1 square = 5 Earned Run\", \n        colors = c(\"#E2D8BD\", \"red\")\n) +\n  labs(title = \"Kansas City vs Fargo-Moorhead: Earned Runs Given Up\",\n       subtitle = \"The two teams gave up almost the same number of earned runs.\",\n       caption = \"Source: Baseball Reference | By Chife Jaeger\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSo after reviewing all of the data from the 2022 American Association season, it is obvious that Kansas City was the best team in baseball based on the big stats. And while they did compile one of the best records in the leagues history, Fargo-Moorhead was able to stay hot on their tails by a number of different smaller aspects of the game, specifically their ability to not give up runs after giving up hits, the ability to not strikeout better than any team in the league, and by having better fielders who gave up way less unearned runs than Kansas City’s.\nWhile Kansas City was able to squeak out the division they were unable to win the championship, but the 2023 season of American Association baseball is underway soon with opening day set for May 11th and the Monarchs will have another chance to dominate the league and make a run for the title."
